# Quantum Mechanical Keyboard Firmware

A slightly modified version of manna-harbour's [miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku) based on [qmk](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) changed for my specific needs.
I use this on a cheapino.

# Building
I use the following command to build:
`make cheapino:manna-harbour_miryoku:flash MIRYOKU_ALPHAS=QWERTY MIRYOKU_TAP=QWERTY MIRYOKU_NAV=VI`

This builds the following layout:
